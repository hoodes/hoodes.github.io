## About

Paula Hoodes was born August 17th, 1990, meaning she was <i>barely</i> booted off her parents' insurance. She currently resides in an tin roof shack underneath the Williamsburg Bridge with a small community of Molemen and newly airborne cockroaches. She enjoys biking, the culinary arts, drawing, fashun, giving a helping hand to the less fortunate, and taking long walks on the beach with Chewy and Kitteh.
